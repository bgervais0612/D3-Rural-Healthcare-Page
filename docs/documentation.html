            The decision to do this project about the state of healthcare in the US and in my state of Iowa came from seeing the consistant lack of healthcare there was in certain rural areas. I have been lucky enough to have not needed
            any special surgeries or procedures, or not be able to receive care, but especially with the abortion bans in large states like Texas, this lack of healthcare is critical. Driving 6 hours is not feasible for most individuals, 
            in order to receive lifesaving care.

            I decided that using a clorapleth of diagrams of the states gives the most realistic view of the state of healthcare in my state of Iowa. You can hover over each of the maps to see how many doctors or OBGYNS there are in a particular 
            county, as well as the per capita rates and the rates of substance admissions. The viewer also gets the perspective of population density centers with major cities being listed. Each chlorapleth has a different color to depict the presense of certain factors. 
            Afterwards, you can also see that two thirds of the counties in Iowa do not have a single OBGYN. This poses a risk should a woman have pregnancy complications. The color green refers to having a doctor (good) and red refers to the absence of a doctor (bad).

            The next plot shows the correlation between substance use and the number of physicians per capita. Honestly, there wasn't much of a correlation. I put the data set in R, hoping to generate the best fitting line, and found that the correlation coefficient was extremely close to 
            zero. You are able to hover over each point to see the particular values for substance admissions and physicians.

            After, there are plots involving the correlation between substance use and proficiency, and proficiency and physicians. The color scheme for both plots was determined with contrast in mind. The blue line of best fit can be seen against the green points
            and contrasts with the dashed, red prediction interval lines. I feel it is easiest of the general public to visualize correlations if there are best fitting lines. The second plot of physicians vs proficiency, does not really have much of a correlation, although
            I included the best fitting line to show this. (Again, this was determined by using R to find the slope and intercepts of the linear model).

            The last visual element compares the states' test scores with the number of doctors in the states. Originally, I had wanted to showcase the access to healthcare, specifically womens' healthcare in larger states such as Texas and California. After Roe was overturned, we are seeing many sad stories out 
            of Texas, where women have to drive 6 hours, are bleeding out in their car etc. due to strict abortion bans. I eventually settled on comparing all the states, because comparing Iowa to only Texas would be restrictive of what information could be shown. 
            I was originally intending to showcase a chloropleth. After scrapping this idea, I thought of maybe using ACT and SAT scores, but the issue with this is that no tests are widely used in each state. For admission into most Iowa colleges, students take the ACT, although this is not the same for high school 
            students in for instance Massachussetts. How do you compare the metrics, especially when only a small percentage of students take one of the test metrics? And, many rural students know they are planning to work on the farm instead of go to college, therefore they do not take one of these standardized tests. I eventually settled on using reading proficiency as the metric. 
            I cycled through many different bar colors before settling on the pale green. If you hover over each bar, you can see the specifications of that state.

            As for overall design choices and thought process, I began with the data and information I hoped to convey. Then I decided to see what other insight I would pull from the data sets I was using. Is there a correlation between substance use and the number of physicians? How does
            the number of physicians compares to education rates. I did not draw out a plan for the web page, my progression simply modeled what I thought I could pull from the data, and correlations I thought I could portray with the data I was using. I think the overall intent was to 
            be a social justice warrior and state that poor, uneducated, republican led states were the ones that have lower numbers of doctors, lower test scores etc, although I cannot and should not make assumptions of the data. I definitely learned from the data and came to conclusions that were unpredictable.
